### 🔧 **Troubleshooting:**

**If the GUI window is not visible:**

- The application might be behind other windows

**If "No barcode found":**
- Ensure the image has good contrast
- Try a higher resolution image
- Make sure the barcode is not rotated
- Use the "Help" button for more tips

**If the application won't start:**
- Ensure Java is installed (java -version)
- Check that lib/*.jar files exist
- Run the compile script first

### 🏆 **What We Achieved:**

### 🚀 **Next Steps (Optional):**

If you want to add webcam support later, we would need to:

2. Add additional webcam capture dependencies
3. Test camera permissions

But for now, you have a **fully working barcode scanner** that can process any barcode image file!
